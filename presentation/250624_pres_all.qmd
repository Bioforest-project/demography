# New research questions

-   Q1: How long does logging affect demographic fluxes?

-   Q2: Relative contribution of demographic processes in the change of functional composition?

-   Q3: Growth models per species (for later...)

# Data explo on relative changes in BA

![](traj_BA_Bafog.png)

-   Identify 8 sites that could be kept based on

    -   the presence of a control

    -   the reliability of %BA changes

-   Clear pattern of increased productivity

# Data exploration of changes in CWM of recruits, death and growth

# Data exploration of changes in CWM of recruits, death and growth

-   Identify 12 sites to keep based on

    -   more than 2 censuses

    -   absence of strange values

-   Look at trends

# How to quantify the contribution of demographic fluxes to functional composition?

$$ \Delta CWM = \frac{\sum _{recr, t+1} BA_i\cdot trait_i}{\sum_{all, t+1} BA_i} + $$ 

$$ \frac{\sum _{alive, t+1} BA_i\cdot trait_i}{\sum_{all, t+1} BA_i} -  
\frac{\sum _{alive, t} BA_i\cdot trait_i}{\sum_{all, t} BA_i} - $$

$$\frac{\sum _{dead, t} BA_i\cdot trait_i}{\sum_{all, t} BA_i}$$

obtained by decomposing $\Delta CWM$


# Standardising

$$ \Delta CWM = \frac{\sum _{recr, t+1} BA_i\cdot (trait_i - CWM_t)}{\sum_{all, t+1} BA_i} + $$ 

$$ \frac{\sum _{alive, t+1} BA_i\cdot (trait_i - CWM_t)}{\sum_{all, t+1} BA_i} -  
\frac{\sum _{alive, t} BA_i\cdot (trait_i - CWM_t)}{\sum_{all, t} BA_i} - $$


$$\frac{\sum _{dead, t} BA_i\cdot (trait_i- CWM_t)}{\sum_{all, t} BA_i}$$
because we developping we end up with $\Delta CWM = \Delta CWM - CWM_t \cdot (1 - 1)$
