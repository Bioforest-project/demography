**demography** is a sub-project of the [**BioForest**](https://github.com/Bioforest-project) project. It aims to analyse tree demographic rates (growth, mortality) in selectively logged forests and their relationship with tree biodiversity and composition, as well as abiotic factors (climate, soil, etc.).

## Usage

All **demography** analyses rely on the quarto documents (`files.qmd`) that can be run with R and associated environment defined with [renv](#0).

## Project

**demography** includes:

-   Analyse of the data with associated [documentation and figures](https://bioforest-project.github.io/demography/):
    -   Reproducible analyses in `files.qmd`
    -   Resulting pages in `docs/`
    -   Document structure definition in `_quarto.yml`
-   Data in `data/` with:
    -   All raw data in `raw_data/`
    -   All derived data in `derived_sata/`
-   Stan Bayesian models in `models/`
-   Stan Bayesian models outputs in `chains/`
-   R scripts with functions in `r/`
-   Intermediary files in `outputs/`
-   Figures in `figures/`
-   R environment definition with [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) in `renv/` and `renv/lock`
-   R files (`.Rbuildignore` , `.Rdata` , `.Rprofile` , `.Rhistory`, `.lintr`)
-   Git and GitHub files (`.gitignore` , `.github/`)
-   Project documentation (`README.qmd` , `README.md` , `NEWS.md`, `LICENSE` )
