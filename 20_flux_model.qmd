# Integrating fluxes and stocks

To create a consistent framework between fluxes (influx: productivity and outflux: mortality) and stocks, we integrate fluxes to estimate stocks as follows:

$$\frac{d (stocks(t))}{dt} = prod(t) - mort(t)$$

$$ stocks(t) = stocks(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^{t} \left(prod - mort \right) $$ Additionally, since we assume that stocks are asymptotically stable, influxes and outfluxes have the same asymptotic value.

$$lim_{\infty}(prod) = lim_{\infty}(mort)$$

The **advantages** of this approach are that we can reduce the number of parameters and create an explicit link between stocks and fluxes, which ensures better consistency in our predictions.
